# NOTE
This was my very first game dev project, built for a University course final project.

# Executive summary
- Procedurally generated mazes ensure that players will never see the same level twice   
- Engaging upgrade system entices players to try different strategies to complete levels
- Progressive difficulty means more challenging mazes and enemies

# BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
- Build for PC with Unity 5.3.2f1
