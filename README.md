#Executive summary
	Talos Origins is a two-dimensional procedurally generated action-exploration RPG
	in a sci-fi setting that focuses on increasing your character’s abilities to unravel
	the mystery behind his journey.
	
#Project Description
	With each level being an increasingly large and challenging procedurally generated maze,
	players will never see the same stage twice. Traversing each maze involves using the
	breadcrumb mechanic which lets players know where they’ve been, along with the grapple
	which allows them to effortlessly navigate across the field of asteroids and enemies.

	Each stage is filled with a random assortment of enemies that, when killed, release collectible
    resources that can be spent on improving and expanding the protagonist’s repertoire of abilities,
	to better serve him on his quest to find his creator, and aid him in conquering the increasingly 
	difficult enemies that stand in his path.
